(This is from Cael and Wood)

Ron -

	As we mentioned the other day, we would not mind if Zilch and
Emacs were left unsupported (as long as Zilch remains in the symbol
tables); it would upset us if Emacs were to become supported and not Zilch.

Here are some favorable points about Zilch:

	* excellent CAI introductory and advanced courses
	* Comprehensive reference manual
	* already has happy local user base at SKB -
		Regular users:
			WOOD
			CAEL
			DUNCAN
			GORDON
			HYLTON
			PETER YOUNG
		Part-time users:
			DON MATTES
			PACKER
	* ability to select files to edit with wild card file names
		(this feature is used frequently)
	* has multi-page capability - each page
		is a collection of windows into one or more files.
		(this feature is used frequently)
	* maintains file protection of edited files
		(this feature is essential)
	* can re-write old versions of files if desired
	* less buffered IO when setting host than Emacs
	* developed in house - fast response to bugs, new OS versions,
		compatible with in house communications,  etc.
	* pride of local development
	* inevitability - will be there anyway

Here are some unfavorable points about Emacs:

	* Emacs also takes development and maintenance time -
		(eg. Rothaus, Wood, Magee.)
	* Emacs takes startup time for interested analysts.
		(ie. creating initialization files)
	* no tutorials - how will it be taught?
	* Emacs is more complex than Zilch - requires more training and support
	* 2000+ cost/machine
	* Maintenance timeliness on support of major OS releases is not
	  predictable.
	* no pages
	* no maintenance of file protection
	* no wild card file names

Obviously Emacs has its good points too. In fact it is a really great editor,
in some ways better than Zilch.  However we (and others - see below) feel that
99% of the time Zilch is sufficient; also there are many little things in
addition to the above points which make Zilch easier to use.

Wood released Zilch about a year ago on the Decus tape;
the person below (among others) called Wood up about Zilch -
he said the following:

Alan Broder
CGR Medical
7210 Ambassador Rd.
Baltimore, MD. 21207
301 298 3160

Loves Zilch, their site uses it a lot.
He wants to use it on Televideos Zenith terminals.
Could I release source to add new terminals? (NO)
--->  Cleaner than Emacs, Emacs too cluttered.   <---
