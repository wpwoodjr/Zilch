wi_status - needs work
mp_reread etc still needs work.
should mp_read_file change mapping type?
	its disconcerting, eg wvAAV2.SEQwrBUFFER.RAT reads, changes mapping
	also, what todo when wmSEQ fails? reread under old map, keep dot/bow
		could not delete text buffer till SEQ read successful
		or save old dot,bow in bu_dot, bu_bow
in q_mp_reread, should i use bu, or bu_parent(bu)?
wmSEQ seems to work ok when file is not in SEQ format, except BOW and DOT
	are lost.  maybe need a reread func which saves dot&bunny for text files
have to STOP in q_fi_read_Seq_file when gap size too small?
	actually, maybe FILEIO should stop! overwrites past end of buffer?!!!
check uses of bu_map_sub_buffers and bu_parent
check uses of wi_map_sub_buffers and wi_parent
$ x aav2.seq
wh
wmtext
wmseq

no work - infloop
$ x aav2.seq aav2    no work - infloop
wi_switch_to_buffer should re-use old windows so that wi_min_size is constant
write bu_delete_sub_buffer correctly
q_mp_read_file in fi_read_named_file could screw up the buffer
may need bu_delete to delete bu_seq buffer
need to check mp_reread when bu_size = 0
modified after change mapping to seq! must be insert_x in seq_read.????
WW writes wrong buffer name into seq file
need write_file for FI and SEQ?
will need special code for WI probably
>bu_modified = 2 ok in bu_new?

	to read them?
