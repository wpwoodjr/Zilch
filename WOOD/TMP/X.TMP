The C-glycosyl thiazole tiazofurin (2-\1b\0-D-ribofuranosylthiazole
 -4-carboxamide; 
NSC286193 (1))
has demonstrated significant antitumor activity in several in vivo model
tumor systems. In the mouse leukemias P388 and L1210,it prolongs mean survival
time (T/C) by 245% and 230% respectively ~2`.  Further, the drug is essentially
curative for the Lewis lung carcinoma in mice over a broad dosage range ~3`.
Tiazofuriu has also demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity (1).
In comparison, both the corresponding  2'deoxynucleoside 
(2-(2-deoxy-\1b\0-D-erythro-pentofuronosyl) thiazole-4-carboxamide;II) and
the alpha-anomer (2-\1a\0-D-ribofuranosylthiozole-4-carboxamide;III)
are inactive ~4`.
In order to investigate the structural requirements for drug activity, we have
completed single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of all three compounds.
These results are presented and discussed in light of the currently known 
biochemical functions of the active drug.

X-ray Data Collection


.ne 2
.ti +5
(a) 2-\1b\0-D-ribofuranosylthiazole-4-carboxamide (I)


.ne 2
.ti +5
Colorless crystals were grown at room temperature by slow evaporation from
a l0 mM aqueous solution of I. Precession photographs and a preliminary rapid
data scan by diffractometer revealed an orthorhombic crystal system. The only
observed systematic abscences were h00 for h=2n+1, 0k0 for k=2n+1, and
00l for l=2n+1 indicating unambiguously space group P2`1~2`1~2`1~.
Cell dimension and intensity data were collected at room temperature from a
thick rectangular plate of approximate dimensions 0.15 x 0.10 x 0.05 mm
mounted roughly parallel to the a axis. A Nonius CAD-4 diffractometer was 
employed using a graphite monochromater and Cuk\1a\0 radiation. Lattice constants
were obtained by least-squares refinement of the angular settings of 24
reflections in the range 2\1R\0=25-30\1"\0.
 These are indicated in Table I. Reflections
were measured in the range 2|1"\0<2\1R\0<70\1"\0 using the
 \1l\02\1l\0 scan method with a 
variable scan width \1Wl\0= (1.0 + 0.15 TAN\1R\0)#, this angle being extended 25% on
each side for background measurements. The scan rate varied between 0.4 and
2.0 deg/min depending upon the value of \1s\0 (I)/I for each reflection. 
  Data were collected in four octants (-h,#k,#l). 
Only identical redundantly measured intensities were averaged, yielding a total
of 4500 reflections . Of these, 80 had values of \F\1`0~\0|\1~2`\0<0.2\1s\
0(F\1`0~~2\0)
where \1s\0(F\1`"~~2`\0)=[\1s~2`\0(I)+(0.02|F\1`0~\0|\1~2`\0)\1~2`\0]\1~1-2`\0,
 and were reset to 0.2\1s\0(F\1`0~~2\0). However,
all data were used in the subsequent analysis and refinements. Three standard
reflections measured every two hours of X-ray exposure time showed no
decline in intensity. Corrections for Lorentz and polarization factors were
 applied and, in addition, data were corrected for absorption using the 
semi-empirical psi-scan technique ~5`.  A single psi scan was employed, consisting
of 36 measurements of a standard reflection in 10 degree steps of phi with the crystal in
an approximate equi-inclincation setting.

.ne 2
.ti +5
Crystals were obtained as described in reference ~6`.  Preliminary photographic
and counter measurements indicated a monoclinic system with systematic absences
0k0 for k=2n+1, uniquely defining the space group as P2`1~.  Cell dimension
and intensity data were obtained from a crystal of approximate dimensions
0.05 x 0.10 x 0.10  mm mounted roughly parallel to the [101] direction.
The CAD-4 diffractometer was again used with graphite monochromatized CuK\1a\0 
radiation. Lattice constants were obtained as described  above and are listed
in Table I. Intensity data were collected using the parameters and methods
described above with the exception that the variable scan width was
\1Wl\0= (1.17 + 0.15 TAN\1R\0 )\1~"`\0.  2655 reflections (including standards) were
measured in the two equivalent but non-centrosymetrically related octants
(h,k,\1>\01) and (-h,k,\1>01).  In this case the data were averaged, yielding
1132 unique reflections, of which 59 had values of |F\1`"~\0|\1~2`\0<0.2\1a\0
(F\1`0~~2\0)
and were reset to 0.2\1a\0F\1`0~~2\0). All data were used in the 
subsequent analysis. Standard reflections measured as above revealed an 
approximate 5% decline in intensity over the course of the data collection. A
separate linear decay correction was applied to the set of reflections 
collected within each two hour time period.

 Data were corrected for absorption as described
above.

A preliminary report of the structure of II has been presented elsewhere~6`.
However, both the crystal and the data set used in the present study were
of higher quality than those used previously.

(c) 2-alpha-D-ribofuranosylthiazole-4-carboxamide (III)


.ne 2
.ti +5
Colorless rod-shaped crystals were grown by vapor diffusion from  a 
20 ul drop of 10 mM aqueous solution of III in a 20% ethanol reservoir.
Preliminary photographic and counter data indicated a monoclinic system with
systematic absences 0k0 for k=2n+1, uniquely defining the space group
as P2`1~.  Cell dimensions and intensity data were obtained  from a crystal
of approximate dimensions 0.05 x 0.05 x 0.30 mm mounted parallel to 
the b axis.Lattice constants were obtained as described
for I and are listed in Table I. Data were collected on the CAD-4
diffractometer using CuK\1a\0l radiation employing the methods described
for I with the exceptions that   
 the scan speed varied between l.0 and 2.0\1~"`\0/min.  Data were
collected from one unique quadrant (-h,-k,\1>\01), yielding 1142  unique
reflections, of which 25 had values of |F\1`"~\0|\1~2`\0<0.2\1a\0(F\1`"~~2`\0).
These were reset to 0.2\1a\0(F\1`"~~2`\0), but all data were used in the
subsequent  refinements. Three standard reflections measured
every two hours no decline in intensity. 
Lorentz and polarization factors were applied but in this case
no correction for absorption was made.

Structure Solutions and Refinements


.ne 2
.ti +5
All structures were solved by the application of standard Fourier
techniques. In each case the sulfur position was determined from the
Patterson map and the positions of the remaining nonhydrogen atoms
obtained from subsequent least-squares refinements and Fourier maps.
The positions of all hydrogen atoms were then obtained from successive 
difference Fourier maps, employing only low angle data (sin \1R\0/\1g\0<0.4).


.ne 2
.ti +5
All structures were refined using full-matrix least-squares techniques.
The function minimized was \1@\0w(\1W\0F)\1~2`\0  where \1W\0F = |F\1`0~\0| - 
|F\1`"~\0| with weights  w = \11-s~2`\0.  In the early refinements,
values of \1s\0  were calculated according to \1s\0 = \1s \0(F\1`"~~2`\0)/2|F
\1`"~\0|, where \1s\0F\1`"~~2`\0)  is defined as above.
 In the later refinements, weights w = \11-s~2`\0new  were used where
 \1s~2`\0new 
= [\1s~2`\0 + 0.5A|F\1`0~\0|\1~2\0 + 0.5B(sin\1R\0/\1g\0)\1~2`\0]\1~1-2`.
Values of A and B 
  were obtained by a least-squares minimization of the function     
|\1W\0F|\1~2`\0 - \1s~2`\0new for twenty separate segments in |F\1`0~\0| and
sin\1R\0/\1g\0, for each data set.
 Nonhydrogen
atoms were refined anisotropically, the y coordinates of the sulfur
atoms in the two monoclinic structures remaining fixed. Positional
parameters of all hydrogen atoms were refined with isotropic 
temperature factors. The later refinements of each structure included
a Type I isotropic extinction correction and utilized all data. Final
refinements converged to the values of R= \1@\0|\1W\0F|/\1g\0F\1`0~\0|
and Rw = [\1g\0w(\1W\0F)\1~2`\0/\1g\0w|F\1`0~\0|\1~2`\0]\1~1-2`\0 
 listed in Table I. Also listed
for each structure is the discrepancy factor S = [\1g\0w(\1WF)\1~2`\0/(m-n]
\1~1-2`\0.
     The largest final parameter shift observed in all three
structures was 0.18 sigma  ; most were less than 0.10 sigma .
The final difference Fourier maps were featureless.  Atomic
scattering factors for the nonydrogen atoms and anomalous dispersion
corrections for the sulfur atoms were from reference ~7`.
Scattering factors for the hydrogen atoms were those of Stewart, et al ~8`.

Absolute Configuration Determinations


.ne 2
.ti +5
The enantomorphs of structures I, II, and III were also refined, using
the same techniques described above. The values of R`w~  thus obtained
are listed in Table I. Application of Hamilton's significance test ~9` 
to each of the three weighted R factor ratios confirmed the original
absolute configuration assignments at the 99.5% significance level.

RESULTS


.ne 2

The conformations of the three structures are illustrated in Figure 1.
Atomic coordinates  for I, II,
and III are listed in Table II. Bond lengths involving non-hydrogen atoms
are listed in Table III. Selected bond and torsion angles are given in Tables
IV and V respectively.





.ne 2
.ti +5
Thiazole Rings


.ne 2
.ti +5
Bond lengths and angles in the three thiazole rings are similar, most
agreeing within 3-4 sigma. Somewhat larger differences in the C2-N3
and S-C2 bonds suggest contributions from slightly different resonance
forms for each  ring. However, in each case the S-C2 and S-C5 bond lengths
are significanntly shorter than the single S-C(sp~2`)  bond length
 (1.78\1/\0) 
~14` as well as unconjugated S-C(sp~2`)  bond lengths observed in several
thiazolidines and thiazolidinones (cf 1.771, 1.776, 1.777 and 1.782\1/\0)
~10-13`. Similarly,
all N3-C4 bond lengths are shorter than the C(sp~2`)-N(sp~2`)
 single bond
length (1.47\1/\0).  Thus, the thiazole rings display significant conjugation.
This is similar to results observed in other thiazole structures, although
comparison is complicated by the wide variations seen in ring dimensions
upon changes in substituents. Nevertheless, bond lengths and angles
observed here are within a standard deviation of the mean values obtained
from twelve well-refined thiazole structures (R<.10) without protonated
or substituted heterocyclic nitrogens (i.e. C2-N3:1.30(1)\1/\0;  N3-C4:
1.38(1)\1/\0;  C4-C5:1.35(2)\1/\0;  C5-S:1.72(2)\1/\0;  S-C2:1.73(2)\1/\0;
  C2-S-C5:89(1)\1"\0;
 S-C5-C4:110(1)\1~"`\0;  C5-C4-N3:116(1)\1~"`\0;  C4-N3-C2:110(1)\1~"`\0;
 N3-C2-S:115(1)\1~"`\0) ~14-18`.


.ne 2
.ti +5
Deviations from the least-squares planes of the thiazole rings are
listed in Table VI. In general, these are quite small. The thiazole
ring in III is planar within experimental error. Deviations from the
least squares plane in II suggest a very slight envelope type pucker
which may be significant.  This is consistent with the .16\1/\0 deviation of
C1' above the ring plane observed in this structure. The thiazole
ring in I shows a small but significant pucker  similar to
 that suggested in II. In this structure the C2 atom lies slightly
above the least-squares plane with flanking S and N3 atoms lying below
the plane. This is also consistent with the bending of the C2-C1' bond
above the ring plane (evidenced by the deviation in C1') and probably
contributes to the differences seen in bond angles about C2.





.ne 2
.ti +5
Carboxamide Groups


.ne 2
.ti +5
The lengths of the C-O and C-N bonds in the carboxamide groups of I and
III are similar. The Beta-deoxy structure shows a significantly shorter
C-O bond and longer C-N bond , suggesting a greater contribution from the
H`2~N-C=0  resonance form and a smaller contribution from the alternative 
H`2~N~+`=C-0~-`  form. This is consistent with the relatively small number
of hydrogen bonds formed by this group in II (see below). The C(4)-C bond
lengths are similar in all three structures. These are close to the
values observed for extracyclic C(sp~2`) -  C(sp~2`) bonds in other thiazoles which
show relatively little conjugation with the heterocyclic ring (e.g.
1.48,1.482,1.49 and 1.49\1/\0) ~16-19`.  The plane of
the carboxamide group in each structure is rotated relative to the
thiazole ring plane. The O-C-C4-C5 torsion angle in the alpha structure
(III) shows the smallest value (-3.8\1~"`\0).  However, the carboxamide carbon in this 
structure shows the largest displacement from the ring plane (0.143(7)\1/\0),
indicating significant bending of the C4-C bond. This is seen to a lesser
extent in the other two structures. The large (33\1~"`\0) rotation of the
carboxamide group in tiazofurin (I) is probably the result of packing
forces. The carboxamide group in this structure participates in a larger
number of hydrogen bonds than in either II or III (see below).


.ne 2
.ti +5
 Despite the
variation in carboxamide group rotation seen among I, II, and III, in each
structure the carboxamide amino group remains trans to the thiazole ring
C5 and cis to the ring nitrogen N3 (Figure 1).  Rotation of this group cis to C5 would
produce unfavorable steric interactions between the amino hydrogen
HN1 and the ring hydrogen HC5. The geometry observed here avoids these as 
well as optimizing any electrostatic interactions between the amide HN1 
and the lone pair electrons of N3, and between the carbonyl oxygen and 
ring HC5. A similar effect is observed in the structures of several
thiazole- containing antibiotics, all of which possess at least one
free N-substituted carboxamide group on the 4 position of a 2-4 substituted 
 thiazole ring ~20-22`. In each case, the carbox amide nitrogen is
found cis to the ring nitrogen and the carbox amide oxygen
cis to the HC5. The largest carbox amide rotation observed among those 
structures for which coordinates are available is about l5\1~"`\0.





.ne 2
.ti +5
Sugar Moieties


.ne 2
.ti +5
Bond lengths in the three ribose moieties are similar. Several
differences in bond lengths greater than 3-sigma probably reflect
either the absence of the 2'hydroxyl group (C2'-C3' in II) or
differences in sugar pucker~23`.  Differences in bond lengths
between I and III are similar to those seen between other nucleoside
anomeric pairs. All bond lengths are  within the range of those seen in
other beta-ribo ~24`, beta-deoxyribo~25-27` and alpha-ribonucleosides
~28-30` with similar ribose puckering. 


.ne 2
.ti +5
The amplitude T and phase angle P of pseudorotation~31` for
each structure is given in Table V  . Conformations of the three ribose
rings were standard. The Tiazofurin structure (I) adopts a C2'endo
pucker (~2`E)  seen in a number of ribose structures~24`.
The Beta-2'-deoxy analogue (II) shows a similar C3'exo-C2'endo
pucker (#T), falling within the range of conformations most 
commonly seen for deoxyribonucleosides~32`.  The alpha
anomer (III)adopts a pure C3'endo-C2'exo (#T) pucker, essentially
enantiomeric to that seen in the beta structures I and II. This is not
always the case among pairs of anomeric nucleosides~30,33,34`,
although this particular conformation is seen in other alpha 
nucleosides~28-30`.


.ne 2
.ti +5
Conformations about the C4'-C5' bond, defined by the torsion angle
\1d\0(O5'-C5'-C4'-C3') are shown in Table V. These fall within the
three commonly observed ranges, being gauche-trans (t), 
trans-gauche (g-), and gauche-gauche (g+) for I, II, and III
respectively. These conformations are generally associated with the observed
ribofuranosyl puckering~32`.


.ne 2
.ti +5
The C-glycosyl Bonds:  Conformational Stabalization


.ne 2
.ti +5
The lengths of the C-glycosyl bonds C1'-C2 are similar to the
mean values seen for other C-glycosyl nucleosides (1.50(1)\1/\0)~35-37`
as well as values for thiazole and thiazolium derivatives with an sp~3`
 hybridized
carbon on the C2 position (1.50(3)\1/\0)~38-41`.  The conformations about
this bond are defined by the torsion angles \1x\0(O1'-C1'-C2-S), listed
in Table V. A comparison of the conformations of the thiazole
rings relative to the furanose moieties reveals several interesting
features common to all three structures. The magnitudes of \1x\0 lie
within the  range |\1x\0|=30 \1>\011\1~"`\0.  In each case the
thiazole sulfur is cis to the furanose oxygen O1' (Figure 2). Further, the
distance between the two atoms in each case is less than the sum of
their Van der Waals radii (3.30\1/\0).  S\1^^^\001' distances are 2.859,
3.023 and 2.826 \1//0 for structures I, II, and III respectively. Very
similar short intramolecular S\1^^^\00  contacts (2.749-2.901\1/\0) have
been observed in four thiamin analogues conaining substituents
of the form -CH2OR on C2 of the thiazolium ring~39-41`.  Analogous
contacts (2.92-3.08\1/\0) have been observed in several thiazole
derivatives as well~21,41,43`.  Results from a number
of molecular orbital calculations suggest that the thiazole
sulfur has a net positive charge~44,45`.  Thus, the S\1^^^\00 contacts observed
in each structure likely represent an electrostatic
interaction between the heterocyclic sulfur and the lone pair
electrons on the furanose oxygen. Similar, albeit marginally short contacts are also observed
between the thiazole nitrogens N3 and the furanose hydrogens HC1'
(N3...HC1' distances are 2.68, 2.55, and 2.64\1/\0  respectively for
structures I, II, and III.).  Although these contacts are less certain, due to
the lower accuracy of the hydrogen positions, they suggest an 
additional intramolecular electrostatic interaction. These interactions
probably stabilize the conformation of each structure about the
C-glycosyl bond. Further, rotation of the thiazole ring about this bond
may be hindered by steric effects. In structures I and II, rotation
of the ring to more positive values of \1x\0 (counterclockwise in Figure
 2.) would produce  short
contacts between the sulfur atom and the furanose hydrogen HC2' . 
In structure
III, rotation of the ring to more negative values of \1x\0 (clockwise in
Figure 2) would bring the
thiazole sulfur into very short contact  with
the hydroxyl oxygen O2' (2.521 \1/\0 at \1x\0 = -100\1~"`\0). 
Rotation of the rings in all three structures toward \1x\0 = 0\1~^`\0 would 
maximize the steric component of the S\1~^^^`\0O1' interaction described
above. Some relief from these
close contacts could be expected from simultaneous changes in ring
pucker. However, it is possible that the available conformations about
the C-glycosyl bond are restricted to those in which the thiazole
sulfur is generally cis to the furanose O1'.

Molecular Packing and Hydrogen Bonding


.ne 2
.ti +5
Crystal packing and intermolecular hydrogen bonding for I, II, and
III are illustrated in Figures 3,4, and 5. Hydrogen bond
distances and angles are tabulated in Table VII. In general, the crystal
structures are characterized by a rich network of primarily linear hydrogen
bonds linking thiazole ring to thiazole ring, furanose ring to furanose
ring, and thiazole ring to furanose ring. There are no indication for any
thiazole ring stacking interactions. All hydroxyl oxygens act as hydrogen
bond donors. In addition, all exocyclic O5' oxygens act as hydrogen acceptors.
One furanose hydroxyl oxygen in each structure also acts as an acceptor. The
carboxamide group is a highly versatile hydrogen bond forming substituent.
It acts as both donor and acceptor, the number of bonds formed varying with
each structure.


.ne 2
.ti +5
In III, the heterocyclic nitrogen N3 acts as an acceptor in an 
O2'-HO2'\1~^^^`\0N3 bond. This is the only structure in which this nitrogen clearly
participates in any hydrogen bonding. The carboxamide hydrogens HN1 and
HN2 both act as hydrogen donors, while the carboxamide oxygen O acts as an
acceptor in two hydrogen bonds. The fewest number of intermolecular hydrogen
bonds
are found in the beta-deoxy structure, II. In this case, only one carboxamide
hydrogen serves as a donor while the carboxamide oxygen accepts only one
hydrogen in a complementary N-HN1\1~^^^`\0O bond. In contrast, both carboxamide
hydrogens in I participate in H-bond formation. Further, the carboxamide
oxygen in this structure acts as an acceptor in three bonds, the donor
atoms being situated in a distorted tetrahedral arrangement around the
acceptor oxygen.





.ne 2
.ti +5
Discussion


.ne 2
.ti +5
Work by several groups suggests that the oncolytic activity of tiazofurin
(I) is related to its ability to create a state of cellular guanine
nucleotide depression with a subsequent interruption of the cell cycle
in S phase. This is a result of a decline in the guanosine precurser
xanthosine monophosphate due to the inhibition of inosine monophosphate
dehydrogenase (IMPd) (4,46). It has been convincingly 
demonstrated, both in vitro and in vivo, that the major IMPd inhibitor
is an anabolite of I. The tiazofurin molecule is incorporated into
an analogue of the cofactor nicotimamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)
in which the nicotinamide ring is replaced by the thiazole-4-carboxamide
group (Figure 6)~46,47`.  This NAD analogue (TAD) is a more potent IMPd inhibitor
(K`i~ \1f\0 0.5 \1)\0M) than either tiazofurin 5'monophosphate
 (K`i~ \1f\0 0.4mM) or
tiazofurin itself (K`i~ \1f\0 8.2 nM)~4,47`. 


.ne 2
.ti +5
A comparison of both the steric and hydrogen bonding properties of the
thiazole-4-carboxamide ring with those of the nicotinamide ring suggests
a mechanism for the observed IMPd inhibition. The TAD molecule would bind 
at the NAD cofactor binding site, the thiazole-4-carboxamide group
occupying the pocket normally filled by the nicotinamide ring. Although
the structure of IMPd is unknown, single crystal structures of five
other dehydrogenase-cofactor complexes have shown a conservation of
carboxamide-enzyme hydrogen bonding at the nicotinamide end of the cofactor
binding site~48`.  Similarly, enzyme binding studies using NAD
analogues have emphasized the necessity of maintaining both the 
hydrogen bonding abilities of the carboxamide group as well as the
general steric characteristics of the nicotinamide ring in forming binary
or tertiary complexes in several dehydrogenase systems~49`.  The
similar size of the thiazole ring and location of its carboxamide group 
suggest that it could successfully mimic the nicotinamide moiety
in the binding of TAD to IMPd (Figure 7).  However, once bound,
 the thiazole ring
would be unable to accept a hydride ion from the enzyme
substrate, as the uncharged ring is highly resistant to reduction~45,51`.
This mechanism is consistent with the finding that the carboxamide group in
the thiazole-4-position is a requirement for cytotoxicity in the P388
system~4`.


.ne 2
.ti +5
It has been suggested above that the conformations about the C-glycosyl bond
may be limited to those in which the thiazole sulfur is generally cis to the
ribose oxygen 01'.  In this case the location of the thiazole carboxamide group
 would
also be restricted to generally trans conformations relative to
01' (Figure 2).  If binding of TAD to IMPd were analogous to that of
NAD, then the carboxamide moiety in NAD might be expected to occupy a
similar location, relative to the nicotinamide ribose, implying some
restrictions on the sterochemistry of cofactor binding in IMPd.


.ne 2
.ti +5
The inactivity of both the alpha-anomer (III) and the beta-deoxy 
derivative (II) suggest that these species are either not converted to the
corresponding NAD analogues, or, if converted, the analogues do not
effectively bind IMPd. The proposed mechanism for the metabolic synthesis of
TAD involves the formation of tiazofurin-5' monophosphate from I via a kinase
followed by reaction with ATP via NAD pyrophosphorylase~52`.  It is possible
that either of these enzymes is unable to utilize the tiazofurin
analogues as substrates. As seen above, the solid state conformation of the
alpha-anomer ribose is different from that of tiazofurin. If some population
of the alpha-anomer in solution could adopt the same ribose conformation,
the sterochemical relationship of the heterocycle to the sugar would still
remain distinct from that in tiazofurin. Although the beta-deoxy analogue
adopts a similar conformation to that seen in I, it lacks the hydrogen
bonding capability of the 2'-hydroxyl group demonstrated in I and III.


.ne 2
.ti +5
The possibility does exist that either III or II is converted to alpha-TAD
or beta-2'-deoxy TAD analogues respectively. However, the same structural
differences discussed above could adversely influence IMPd binding as
well. This is suggested by the behaviors of similar NAD analogues. Alpha-NADH
does exist in mammalian and microbial systems, although it probably results
from a nonenzymatic anomerization of beta-NADH~50,53`.  The alpha
coenzyme is oxidized by several dehydrogenases, but at rates 3 to 4 orders
or magnitude slower than beta-NADH~53`.  Alpha-NAD is enzymatically inactive
~54`.  Similarly, an NAD analogue containing a beta-2'-3'-dideoxy
nicotinamide ribose is reduced more slowly than NAD by both alcohol and
lactute dehydrogenase~55`. 
 The importance of the nicotinamide ribose 2'-hydroxyl
group is also suggested by the conservation of an enzyme\1~^^^`\002' hydrogen
bond in a number of dehydrogenase-coenzyme crystal structures (48). Thus,
if binding of TAD to IMPd were analogous to that of NAD, an alpha-TAD
or beta-2'-deoxy-TAD might well be inefficient enzyme inhibitors.


.ne 2
.ti +5
Finally, It is worth adding that the thiazole-4-carboxamide group is also
stereochemically similar to the base in inosine suggesting that tiazofurin 5'
-monophosphate(TMP) might be capable of acting as an analogue of the IMPd
substrate inosine 5'-monophosphate 5'.  In this case the mechanism for
enzyme inhibition would be similar to that proposed for the antiviral agent
virazole~57,58`.  Although TMP is not as potent an inhibitor as TAD, the
possible dual role of both a coenzyme and a substrate analogue in IMPd
inhibition has not been ruled out.
