We   briefly   review   Pregibon's  approach  (1981)  to  logistic  regression
diagnostics.  Suppose now that Y ,Y ,...,Y  are independent  random  variables~
                                1  2      n                                   
in the exponential family, and that the density Y  is~
                                                 i   
               g(y ,  ) = exp y    - a(  ) + b(y ) .~
                  i  i         i i      i       i   
Then,      is the natural parameter of Y ,a'(  ) = E(Y ) and a"(  ) = var(Y ).~
        i                               i     i       i          i         i  
                                                      P                              ~
                                                       i____                         ~
For example, if Y  is  binomial,  then       =  ln              ,  where  P   is  the~
                 i                        i                 1-P            i         ~
                                                               i                     
                                 t                                            ~
probability of  success.   Let      =  (  ,  ,...,  ) and suppose that   = X ,~
                                         1  2      n                          
where   is a d-vector of parameters to be estimated, and  X  is  the  "design"
matrix.
