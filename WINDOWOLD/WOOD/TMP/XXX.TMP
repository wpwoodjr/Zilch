     The C-glycosyl     thiazole     tiazofurin     (2-\1b\0-D-ribofuranosylthiazole

-4-carboxamide; NSC286193 (1)) has demonstrated significant  antitumor  activity

in several in vivo model tumor systems. In the mouse leukemias P388 and L1210,it

                                                                2               ~
prolongs mean survival time (T/C) by 245% and 230% respectively  .  Further, the

drug  is  essentially curative for the Lewis lung carcinoma in mice over a broad

             3                                                                  ~

order to investigate the structural requirements  for  drug  activity,  we  have

completed single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of all three compounds. These

results  are presented and discussed in light of the currently known biochemical

functions of the active drug.

X-ray Data Collection



     (a) 2-\1b\0-D-ribofuranosylthiazole-4-carboxamide (I)



     Colorless crystals were grown at room temperature by slow evaporation  from

a  l0  mM  aqueous solution of I. Precession photographs and a preliminary rapid

data scan by diffractometer revealed an orthorhombic crystal  system.  The  only

observed  systematic  abscences were h00 for h=2n+1, 0k0 for k=2n+1, and 00l for

l=2n+1  indicating  unambiguously  space  group  P2 2 2 .  Cell  dimension   and~

intensity data were collected at room temperature from a thick rectangular plate

of  approximate dimensions 0.15 x 0.10 x 0.05 mm mounted roughly parallel to the

a  axis.  A  Nonius  CAD-4  diffractometer  was  employed   using   a   graphite

monochromater   and   Cuk\1a\0   radiation.   Lattice  constants  were  obtained  by

least-squares refinement of the angular settings of 24 reflections in the  range

2\1R\0=25-30\1"\0.  These  are  indicated  in  Table I. Reflections were measured in the

range 2|1"\0<2\1R\0<70\1"\0 using the \1l\02\1l\0 scan method with a variable scan width \1Wl\0=  (1.0

+ 0.15  TAN\1R\0)  ,  this  angle  being  extended  25%  on each side for background

measurements. The scan rate varied between 0.4 and 2.0  deg/min  depending  upon

the  value  of  \1s\0 (I)/I for each reflection. Data were collected in four octants

(-h, k, l). Only  identical  redundantly  measured  intensities  were  averaged,

                                                                  \F\1 \0 \12\0    \1 \    \1 2\0)~
yielding a total of 4500 reflections . Of these, 80 had values of \F\1 \0|\1 \0<0.2\1s\ 0(F\1  \0 ~

reflections measured every two hours of X-ray exposure time showed no decline in

intensity. Corrections for Lorentz and polarization factors were applied and, in

addition,  data  were corrected for absorption using the semi-empirical psi-scan

standard reflection in 10 degree steps of phi with the crystal in an approximate

equi-inclincation setting.

CuK\1a\0  radiation.  Lattice  constants  were  obtained as described  above and are

listed in Table I. Intensity  data  were  collected  using  the  parameters  and

     A preliminary  report of the structure of II has been presented elsewhere .

However, both the crystal and the data set used in the  present  study  were  of

     Colorless rod-shaped  crystals  were grown by vapor diffusion from  a 20 ul

Structure Solutions and Refinements



     All structures  were  solved  by  the  application  of   standard   Fourier

techniques.  In  each case the sulfur position was determined from the Patterson

map  and  the  positions  of  the  remaining  nonhydrogen  atoms  obtained  from

subsequent  least-squares  refinements  and  Fourier  maps. The positions of all

hydrogen atoms were then  obtained  from  successive  difference  Fourier  maps,

employing only low angle data (sin \1R\0/\1g\0<0.4).



     All structures were refined using full-matrix least-squares techniques. The

Thiazole Rings



     Bond lengths and angles in the  three  thiazole  rings  are  similar,  most

agreeing  within  3-4  sigma.  Somewhat larger differences in the C2-N3 and S-C2

bonds suggest contributions from slightly different resonance forms  for  each  

ring.  However,  in  each case the S-C2 and S-C5 bond lengths are significanntly

shorter  than  the C(sp )-N(sp ) single bond length (1.47\1/\0).  Thus, the thiazole

rings display significant conjugation. This is similar to  results  observed  in

other  thiazole  structures,  although  comparison  is  complicated  by the wide

variations seen in ring dimensions upon changes in  substituents.  Nevertheless,

bond  lengths  and  angles  observed here are within a standard deviation of the

mean values  obtained  from  twelve  well-refined  thiazole  structures  (R<.10)

without protonated  or substituted heterocyclic nitrogens (i.e. C2-N3:1.30(1)\1/\0; 

N3-C4:    1.38(1)\1/\0;      C4-C5:1.35(2)\1/\0;      C5-S:1.72(2)\1/\0;      S-C2:1.73(2)\1/\0;

     Deviations from the least-squares planes of the thiazole rings  are  listed

in  Table  VI.  In  general,  these are quite small. The thiazole ring in III is

planar within experimental error. Deviations from the least squares plane in  II

suggest  a  very  slight envelope type pucker which may be significant.  This is

consistent with the . 16\1/\0 deviation of C1' above the ring plane observed in this

structure. The thiazole ring in I shows a small but significant pucker   similar


                                                                          Page 8


to  that  suggested in II. In this structure the C2 atom lies slightly above the

least-squares plane with flanking S and N3 atoms lying below the plane. This  is

also  consistent  with  the  bending  of  the  C2-C1'  bond above the ring plane

(evidenced by the deviation in C1') and probably contributes to the  differences

seen in bond angles about C2.





Carboxamide Groups



     The lengths of the C-O and C-N bonds in the carboxamide groups of I and III

are similar. The Beta-deoxy structure shows a significantly shorter C-O bond and

longer C-N  bond , suggesting a greater contribution from the H N-C=0  resonance~
                                                               2

form and a smaller contribution from the alternative H N =C-0    form.  This  is~
                                                      2                         

consistent  with  the  relatively  small number of hydrogen bonds formed by this

group in II (see below). The C(4)-C  bond  lengths  are  similar  in  all  three

                                                                           2    ~

the  heterocyclic ring (e.g. 1.48,1.482,1.49 and 1.49\1/\0)      .  The plane of the

carboxamide group in each structure is rotated relative  to  the  thiazole  ring

plane.  The  O-C-C4-C5  torsion  angle  in  the  alpha structure (III) shows the

                    \1"\0                                                           ~
smallest value (-3.8\1 \0).  However, the carboxamide carbon in this structure shows

the largest displacement from the ring plane (0.143(7)\1/\0), indicating significant

bending of the C4-C bond. This is seen to a  lesser  extent  in  the  other  two

                          \1"\0                                                     ~
structures.  The large (33\1 \0) rotation of the carboxamide group in tiazofurin (I)

is probably the  result  of  packing  forces.  The  carboxamide  group  in  this

structure participates in a larger number of hydrogen bonds than in either II or


                                                                          Page 9


III (see below).



     Despite the  variation  in carboxamide group rotation seen among I, II, and

III, in each structure the carboxamide amino group remains trans to the thiazole

ring C5 and cis to the ring nitrogen N3 (Figure 1).  Rotation of this group  cis

to  C5  would produce unfavorable steric interactions between the amino hydrogen

HN1 and the ring hydrogen HC5. The geometry observed here avoids these  as  well

as  optimizing any electrostatic interactions between the amide HN1 and the lone

pair electrons of N3, and between the carbonyl oxygen and ring  HC5.  A  similar

effect   is   observed   in  the  structures  of  several  thiazole-  containing

antibiotics, all of which possess at least one  free  N-substituted  carboxamide

                                                            20-22               ~
group  on the 4 position of a 2-4 substituted thiazole ring      . In each case,

the carbox amide nitrogen is found cis to the ring nitrogen and the carbox amide

oxygen cis to the HC5. The largest carbox amide rotation  observed  among  those

Sugar Moieties



     Bond lengths  in the three ribose moieties are similar. Several differences

in bond lengths greater than 3-sigma probably reflect either the absence of  the

                                                                23              ~
2'hydroxyl  group (C2'-C3' in II) or differences in sugar pucker  .  Differences

in bond lengths between I and III  are  similar  to  those  seen  between  other

nucleoside  anomeric pairs. All bond lengths are  within the range of those seen

                   24                25-27                           28-30      ~

The C-glycosyl Bonds:  Conformational Stabalization

torsion  angles  \1x\0(O1'-C1'-C2-S),  listed  in  Table  V.  A  comparison  of  the

conformations of the thiazole rings relative to the  furanose  moieties  reveals

several interesting features common to all three structures. The magnitudes of \1x\0

lie  within  the  range |\1x\0|=30 \1>\011\1 \0.  In each case the thiazole sulfur is cis to

the furanose oxygen O1' (Figure 2). Further, the distance between the two  atoms

in each case is less than the sum of their Van der Waals radii (3.30\1/\0).  S\1^^^\001'

distances  are  2.859,  3.023  and  2.826  \1/\0  for  structures  I,  II,  and  III

respectively. Very similar short intramolecular S\1^^^\00   contacts  (2.749-2.901\1/\0)

have  been observed in four thiamin analogues conaining substituents of the form

                                   39-41                                \1 \0       ~
-CH2OR on C2 of the thiazolium ring     .  Analogous contacts (2.92-3.08\1/\0)  have

                                                       21,41,43                 ~
been  observed  in several thiazole derivatives as well        .  Results from a

number of molecular orbital calculations suggest that the thiazole sulfur has  a

                     44,45              \1   \0                                     ~
net  positive  charge     .  Thus, the S\1^^^\00 contacts observed in each structure

likely represent an electrostatic interaction between  the  heterocyclic  sulfur

and  the  lone pair electrons on the furanose oxygen. Similar, albeit marginally

short contacts are also observed between  the  thiazole  nitrogens  N3  and  the

furanose hydrogens  HC1'  (N3...HC1'  distances  are  2.68,  2.55,  and  2.64\1/\0  

respectively for structures I, II, and III.).  Although these contacts are  less

certain,  due  to  the lower accuracy of the hydrogen positions, they suggest an

additional intramolecular electrostatic interaction. These interactions probably

stabilize the conformation of each structure about the C-glycosyl bond. Further,

rotation of the thiazole ring about this bond may be hindered by steric effects.

In structures I and II, rotation of the  ring  to  more  positive  values  of  \1x\0

(counterclockwise in Figure 2.) would produce  short contacts between the sulfur

atom and  the furanose hydrogen HC2' . In structure III, rotation of the ring to

more negative values of \1x\0 (clockwise in  Figure  2)  would  bring  the  thiazole

sulfur  into  very  short  contact  with the hydroxyl oxygen O2' (2.521 \1/\0 at \1x\0 =


                                                                         Page 12

-100\1 \0). Rotation of the rings in all  three  structures  toward  \1x\0  =  0\1 \0  would

                                        \1^^^\0                                     ~
maximize  the  steric component of the S\1   \0O1' interaction described above. Some

relief from these close contacts could be expected from simultaneous changes  in

ring  pucker. However, it is possible that the available conformations about the

C-glycosyl bond are  restricted  to  those  in  which  the  thiazole  sulfur  is

generally cis to the furanose O1'.





Molecular Packing and Hydrogen Bonding



     Crystal packing  and intermolecular hydrogen bonding for I, II, and III are

illustrated in Figures 3,4, and  5.  Hydrogen  bond  distances  and  angles  are

tabulated  in Table VII. In general, the crystal structures are characterized by

a rich network of primarily linear  hydrogen  bonds  linking  thiazole  ring  to

thiazole  ring,  furanose  ring  to furanose ring, and thiazole ring to furanose

ring. There are no indication for any thiazole ring stacking  interactions.  All

hydroxyl  oxygens  act  as  hydrogen bond donors. In addition, all exocyclic O5'

oxygens act  as  hydrogen  acceptors.  One  furanose  hydroxyl  oxygen  in  each

structure  also acts as an acceptor. The carboxamide group is a highly versatile

hydrogen bond forming substituent. It acts  as  both  donor  and  acceptor,  the

number of bonds formed varying with each structure.



     In III,   the   heterocyclic   nitrogen  N3  acts  as  an  acceptor  in  an

        \1^^^\0                                                                     ~
O2'-HO2'\1   \0N3 bond. This is the only structure in which  this  nitrogen  clearly

participates in any hydrogen bonding. The carboxamide hydrogens HN1 and HN2 both

act  as  hydrogen  donors, while the carboxamide oxygen O acts as an acceptor in

two hydrogen bonds. The fewest number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds are found


                                                                         Page 13


in the beta-deoxy structure, II. In this case,  only  one  carboxamide  hydrogen

serves  as  a  donor while the carboxamide oxygen accepts only one hydrogen in a

                   \1^^^\0                                                          ~
complementary N-HN1\1   \0O bond. In  contrast,  both  carboxamide  hydrogens  in  I

participate  in  H-bond  formation.  Further,  the  carboxamide  oxygen  in this

structure acts as an acceptor in three bonds, the donor atoms being situated  in

a distorted tetrahedral arrangement around the acceptor oxygen.





Discussion



     Work by  several  groups suggests that the oncolytic activity of tiazofurin

(I) is related to its ability to create a state of cellular  guanine  nucleotide

depression  with a subsequent interruption of the cell cycle in S phase. This is

a result of a decline in the guanosine precurser xanthosine monophosphate due to

the inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPd) (4,46). It has been

convincingly demonstrated, both in vitro  and  in  vivo,  that  the  major  IMPd

inhibitor  is an anabolite of I. The tiazofurin molecule is incorporated into an

analogue of the cofactor nicotimamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)  in  which  the

nicotinamide  ring  is  replaced  by  the  thiazole-4-carboxamide  group (Figure

  46,47                                                               \1 \0      \1 \0  ~

     A comparison of both the steric and  hydrogen  bonding  properties  of  the

thiazole-4-carboxamide  ring  with  those  of  the  nicotinamide ring suggests a

mechanism for the observed IMPd inhibition. The TAD molecule would bind  at  the


                                                                         Page 14


NAD cofactor binding site, the thiazole-4-carboxamide group occupying the pocket

normally  filled  by  the  nicotinamide  ring. Although the structure of IMPd is

unknown,  single  crystal  structures  of  five   other   dehydrogenase-cofactor

complexes  have  shown  a conservation of carboxamide-enzyme hydrogen bonding at

                                                 48                             ~
the nicotinamide end of the cofactor binding site  .  Similarly, enzyme  binding

studies  using  NAD  analogues have emphasized the necessity of maintaining both

the hydrogen bonding abilities of the carboxamide group as well as  the  general

steric  characteristics  of  the nicotinamide ring in forming binary or tertiary

                                          49                                    ~
complexes in several dehydrogenase systems  .  The similar size of the  thiazole

ring  and  location  of its carboxamide group suggest that it could successfully

mimic the nicotinamide moiety  in  the  binding  of  TAD  to  IMPd  (Figure  7).

However,  once  bound, the thiazole ring would be unable to accept a hydride ion

from the enzyme  substrate,  as  the  uncharged  ring  is  highly  resistant  to

         45,51                                                                  ~
reduction     .   This  mechanism  is  consistent  with  the  finding  that  the

carboxamide group in the thiazole-4-position is a requirement  for  cytotoxicity

in the P388 system .



     It has  been  suggested  above  that the conformations about the C-glycosyl

bond may be limited to those in which the thiazole sulfur is  generally  cis  to

the  ribose  oxygen  01'.  In this case the location of the thiazole carboxamide

group would also be restricted to generally trans conformations relative to  01'

(Figure  2).   If binding of TAD to IMPd were analogous to that of NAD, then the

carboxamide moiety in NAD might  be  expected  to  occupy  a  similar  location,

relative   to  the  nicotinamide  ribose,  implying  some  restrictions  on  the

sterochemistry of cofactor binding in IMPd.



     The inactivity of both the alpha-anomer (III) and the beta-deoxy derivative


                                                                         Page 15


(II) suggest that these species are either not converted  to  the  corresponding

NAD analogues, or, if converted, the analogues do not effectively bind IMPd. The

proposed  mechanism for the metabolic synthesis of TAD involves the formation of

tiazofurin-5' monophosphate from I via a kinase followed by  reaction  with  ATP

                           52                                                   ~
via  NAD  pyrophosphorylase  .   It  is possible that either of these enzymes is

unable to utilize the tiazofurin analogues as substrates.  As  seen  above,  the

solid  state  conformation  of the alpha-anomer ribose is different from that of

tiazofurin. If some population of the alpha-anomer in solution could  adopt  the

same  ribose  conformation, the sterochemical relationship of the heterocycle to

the sugar would still remain distinct from  that  in  tiazofurin.  Although  the

beta-deoxy  analogue  adopts  a similar conformation to that seen in I, it lacks

the hydrogen bonding capability of the 2'-hydroxyl group demonstrated in  I  and

III.



     The possibility  does exist that either III or II is converted to alpha-TAD

or beta-2'-deoxy  TAD  analogues  respectively.  However,  the  same  structural

differences discussed above could adversely influence IMPd binding as well. This

is suggested by the behaviors of similar NAD analogues. Alpha-NADH does exist in

mammalian   and   microbial   systems,  although  it  probably  results  from  a

                                       50,53                                    ~

several dehydrogenases, but at rates 3 to 4  orders  or  magnitude  slower  than

beta-NADH  .   Alpha-NAD  is  enzymatically  inactive    .   Similarly,  an  NAD

analogue containing a beta-2'-3'-dideoxy nicotinamide  ribose  is  reduced  more

                                                           55                   ~
slowly  than  NAD by both alcohol and lactute dehydrogenase  . The importance of

the nicotinamide ribose 2'-hydroxyl group is also suggested by the  conservation

structures (48). Thus, if binding of TAD to IMPd were analogous to that of  NAD,

an alpha-TAD or beta-2'-deoxy-TAD might well be inefficient enzyme inhibitors.



     Finally, It  is  worth adding that the thiazole-4-carboxamide group is also

stereochemically similar to the base in inosine suggesting  that  tiazofurin  5'

-monophosphate(TMP)  might  be  capable  of  acting  as  an analogue of the IMPd

substrate inosine 5'-monophosphate 5'.  In this case the  mechanism  for  enzyme

inhibition   would   be  similar  to  that  proposed  for  the  antiviral  agent

        57,58                                                                   ~
virazole     .  Although TMP is not as potent an inhibitor as TAD, the  possible

dual role of both a coenzyme and a substrate analogue in IMPd inhibition has not

been ruled out.
