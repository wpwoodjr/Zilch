what is this code for in bu_clear_text: (can we delete this horrible routine?)
      if (sb == bu)
	bu_current(sb) = 1
      else
	bu_current(sb) = 0

should save bu_current in restore files
(Jul 29, 1987)marks 1 & 2 not being restored from .zil files - I think bu_clear text is kill
	ing it FIXED BY NOT CLEARING IF BU_MODIFIED=2
.)  bu_bow and bu_dot may not be worth saving in .zil files
.1) make wi_switch_to_buffer save and unsave bu_dot and bu_bow
.2) delete separate tx_buffer stuff; use sub-buffers instead
.3) can (cancel) bu_window list, use buffer markers instead for wi_dot and
	wi_bow changes? (2/20/87 - hard to do for wi_bow)
>> .4) fix [] in file names
>> .5) add bu_checkpointed; can be used to only chkp when modif
	since last chkp. DONE as bu_modified=3 1/29/87
1) smart binder knows about insert mode substitutes in_ etc.
2) smart mode changer knows about insert mode
3) insert mode -> 9, control -> 8 ??
5) exit if in insert mode function? or use smart mode changer?
7) word wrap with special line terminator - ^M is hard-coded newline
8) mode reflected in mode line - named modes?
9) mode stored with buffer for buffer-by-buffer modes?
>> 10) upper-lower case binds - ugh DONE
11) %keypad associated with mode
>> 12) write save buffer to file function with no visit file DONE - ^P
>> 13) need an illegal_function operator! DONE
15) \{ - \<LF> - any others?
16) modes associated with terminals
17) window list and help - <CR> problem.
>> 18) what about conversion to upper case? in tty? bad. DONE
20) overstrike function? ala mess-11?
21) window ignore command? too dangerous?
23) delete chars is too jerky - why? (jerkier than oldupdate)
24) ^N - Numeric keypad toggle Nonnumeric keypad
25) Macros always exit insert mode
26) enter key inserts a file
27) checkpoint crashes
